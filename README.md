# AutoDataForge: Advanced Data Pipeline for Automotive Manufacturing

## Overview

AutoDataForge is a comprehensive data engineering solution designed for large-scale automotive manufacturers. This project aims to collect, process, and analyze vast amounts of data from various stages of the automotive lifecycle, including design, manufacturing, quality control, and post-sale vehicle performance. The insights derived from this data pipeline will drive innovation, improve production efficiency, and enhance vehicle quality and customer satisfaction.

## Features

- Real-time data ingestion from multiple sources (IoT sensors, production lines, vehicle telemetry)
- Scalable data processing using Apache Spark
- Stream processing with Apache Kafka for real-time analytics
- Data lake solution using Delta Lake for efficient storage and querying
- ETL pipelines for data transformation and enrichment
- Machine learning models for predictive maintenance and quality control
- Data visualization dashboards using Power BI
- Automated data quality tests and monitoring
- CI/CD pipeline for data workflows

## Tech Stack

- Apache Spark: Large-scale data processing
- Apache Kafka: Real-time data streaming
- Delta Lake: Data lake storage
- Apache Nifi: Data flow automation and management
- Docker: Containerization
- Kubernetes: Container orchestration
- Python: Primary programming language

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- Apache Spark
- Apache Kafka
- Delta Lake
- Apache Nifi

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/autodataforge.git
   cd autodataforge
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Initialize the data lake:
   ```
   docker-compose run spark-master ./init_data_lake.sh
   ```

4. Access the Apache Nifi web interface:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/nifi
   ```

## Usage

1. Configure your data sources in Apache Nifi using the web interface
2. Import the main data flow template from `nifi_templates/main_data_flow.xml`
3. Start the Nifi data flow
4. Monitor your data pipelines through the Nifi web interface

## Data Quality Tests

We use Great Expectations for data quality testing. Test suites are located in the `tests/quality/` directory.

To run data quality tests:

1. Navigate to the project root
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   great_expectations checkpoint run my_checkpoint
   ```

This will execute the defined expectations against your data and generate a data quality report.

## CI/CD

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/`. They include:

- Automated testing on pull requests
- Data quality checks on scheduled intervals
- Deployment of updated Nifi templates to production
